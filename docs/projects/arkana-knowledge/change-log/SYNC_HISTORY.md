# Documentation Sync History - arkana-knowledge

## 2026-05-02 - Operational Memory Sync (no doc changes)
**Commit Range**: `b61a39ec..85b4f01` (21 commits)
**Previous Sync**: `b61a39ec`
**Current Sync**: `85b4f01`
**Synced By**: /update-project skill
**Status**: Tracking-only update — no documentation changes required

**Changes Analyzed**:
- 14 files changed, all under `memory/` (agent logs, executive-digest queue, project-context, slack-log)
- Routine agent activity: issue-triage, security-triage, release-coordinator, repo-detector, repo-sync, research-monitor, sdk-parity, slack-monitor, linear-sync, executive-digest
- No changes to code, architecture, configuration, dependencies, APIs, agent prompts, MCP server, Slack bot, webhook relay, infrastructure, or policies

**Files Updated**:
- `change-log/last-sync.txt` → `85b4f01`
- `change-log/SYNC_HISTORY.md` → this entry

**Master INDEX Updates**: None (capabilities, tags, dependencies, and depended-on-by relationships unchanged)

**Notes**:
- All commits are operational state updates produced by Arkana's scheduled agents — by design these do not alter the documented system surface
- Documentation files under `system/`, `testing/`, and `sop/` remain accurate
